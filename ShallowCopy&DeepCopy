// javascript is a single threaded , synchronous dynamically typed, language
// single threaded because it has single call stack and is executed line by line
// dynamically means the we can change it at the run time

let a = 10;
console.log(typeof(a));

a = "suraj";
console.log(typeof(a)); //we can change at run time

// node.js is a runtime environment

// var let and const are all hoisted but (let, const) are in (temporal dead zone)

// primitive and non primitive


// Promise: is a object that has three state (fullfilled rejected pending)

// async / await is a method to resolve promises



// how can we acheive asynchronous in js?
// using callbacks,promise, and async / await



//shallow copy
let obj = {
    name:"suraj",
    city:"bangalore"
}

// var copyObj = obj;
// copyObj.name = "sanjeev"
// console.log(obj);
// console.log(copyObj);


var deepCopy = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(obj));

deepCopy.name = "sanjeev";
console.log(obj);
console.log(deepCopy);



// a fucntion passed as an argument  to another function is called a callback function;
